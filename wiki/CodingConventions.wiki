The following notes might help to understand the source code:

In comments '>var' is used to reference a variable name.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, assume the following:
{{{
// caller is responsible for deleting the Object
Object *function() 
{
  // something like 
  return new Object(...);
}

// probably not to be deleted by caller, and NULL
// is used as special return value
const Object *function()

// caller has to think about the Objects lifetime
// (which is probably tied to some >context)
Object &function(... &context)

// callee will take ownership/delete the Object
void function(Object *obj)

// callee will not take ownership, but NULL has
// probably a special meaning
void function(const Object *obj)
}}}

Indentation should be obvious from the source, but here a few examples:
{{{
class Xy {
public:
  void xy();
};

void foo()
{
  for (int iA=0;iA<10;iA++) {
    if (x(iA)) {
      statement1();
      statement2();
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  if ( (cond1)&&(cond2) ) {
  }
  // the spacing between the braces indicates the nesting level
  if (  ( (cond1)||(cond2) )&&
        ( (cond3)||(cond4) )&&(cond5)  ) {
    something();
  }
}
}}}
