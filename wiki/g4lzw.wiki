#summary The g4coder / lzwcoder libraries.

You can checkout these libraries separately using:

`svn checkout http://unpdf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/g4coder g4coder`

resp.

`svn checkout http://unpdf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lzwcoder lzwcoder`

(the lzwcoder repository currently contains a symbolic link to the
files `gfxfiles.c`/`gfxfiles.h` from g4coder. If you want only lzwcoder
you have to get them separately from g4coder...)

The libs also include a small command-line utility to for en-/decoding.
For usage see

`g4coder --help`

resp.

`lzwcoder --help`


Have a look at `g4coder/g4code.h` for the C API, even when only using lzwcoder.
