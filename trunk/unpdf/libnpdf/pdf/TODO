- only one PDF class in the future;
  maybe PDFWriter; probably PDFCopier
    i.e. with OutPDF::remap_array / remap_dict

- remove ObjectSet crazyness
  - "makeIndirect" ... objectCache ...

- move code out of PDF ctor
- make security a unique_ptr

- fix pdfcomp.cpp   (also affects stream/)

- make "OutPDF" (or, what it will become) work with generic Output, not just FILEOutput

- better output filter selecting, e.g. by giving OFilter a "preliminary" dictionary.
  ? we do have the ability to use the dict from reading the pdf, but we want to change it!
  and we have no good method to choose different filter for different objects (images, text, "by id", ...)
    - maybe ObjectCopier helps?
