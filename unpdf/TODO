prettify output of <<>> etc
OutPDF shall not take (FILEOutput &fo), but s.th. like SummingOutput(...) 
don't use  too much bool default parameters, but special enums

  general method to make dict/array values all direct (problem: either we prespecify the keys,
  or we can't know what hides behind a ref -- but generally we'd expect a certain type)
    * main area for now is the StandardSecurityHandler (which might want to use a std::map? [but strings as keys are uncool])
    * another plase is the IFilter decode-param array

  move convenience methods from Dict to ObjectPtr

- simple tool to extract the image on a certain page
- another lib, that scales(!) a pbm (from g4coder) to a pgm suitable for libpng. (different resolutions, fast [later: + high quality])
